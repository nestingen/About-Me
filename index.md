# About Me
My name is Amy Nestingen and I currently work as a Supply Chain Optimization Analyst at Graphic Packaging in Atlanta. My main focuses are creating a Network Optimization model with Llamasoft and developing BI tools with Qlik Sense. I graduated from Iowa State University in 2017 with a double major in Statistics and Supply Chain. I graduated from Bellevue University in 2021 with a Masters in Data Science. I love learning new skills and working on teams that deliver value.
